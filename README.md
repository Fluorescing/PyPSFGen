# PyPSFGen
A fast Python simulated-molecule/point-spread-function (PSF) image generator.

## Synopsis

<!--At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)-->

## Code Example

<!--Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.-->

## Motivation

This project is meant to be a stepping stone for work on a molecule-localization project.  It allows for creating single- or multi molecule images from the command line quickly, making batched tests simplier.  It is also written in Python 2.7 for simple code and compatibility--all packages used can be installed via pip.

## Installation

<!--Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.-->

<!--## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.-->

## Tests

<!--Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.-->

## Contributors

<!--Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.-->
